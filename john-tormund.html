          In his scene with the Wildling, Jon tells him that Ghost will be
          happier up north,to which Tormund replies, “So would you.” Jon then
          says he wishes he was going with him as well, before adding, “This is
          farewell then.” Tormund isn’t so sure, however, telling him, “You
          never know.” And before walking off, he adds, “You got the north in
          you, the real north.”
