          The story told in Game of Thrones
           was adapted by series writers David Benioff
            and D. B. Weiss from George R. R. Martin's fantasy
            book series A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin published 
            the first book of the series, Game of Thrones, in 1996. 
            The book was originally intended to be the first part of a 
            trilogy, each following one of the three major plot lines, 
            but as Martin wrote, the story expanded into what he now expects to be a seven-book series.
            Game of Thrones is an HBO series that tells the story of a medieval
           country's civil war. The series, which premiered in April 2011, is 
           set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos in a world where 
           seasons stretch on for years. When the story begins, a decade-long summer 
           is ending, and winter looms as characters battle to claim the "Iron Throne," 
           the seat of the king of the Seven Kingdoms, the regime that rules all but 
           northern tip of Westeros. In show parlance, "sit on the Iron Throne" is a metonym equivalent to "rule Westeros."
           The show is divided into three major plot lines. The first covers the battle 
           between the lords of the continent of Westeros — most notably members of the 
           Baratheon, Lannister, and Stark families — who are involved in the fight for 
           the Iron Throne. The second follows the rise of Daenerys Targaryen, the last 
           member of an exiled family as she builds an army in Essos to reclaim the throne. 
           The third plot takes place in the North of Westeros among the Night's Watch, an 
           armed unit that guards the 300-mile-long, 70-foot-tall wall that protects the rest 
           of the continent from the mythical creatures that lurk there.
